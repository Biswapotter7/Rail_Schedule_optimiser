# Railway Schedule Optimizer

The objective is to optimize the scheduling and coordination of train movements to reduce delays and improve overall efficiency in the transportation system. By carefully analyzing and optimizing train routes, timetables, and resource allocation, we seek to minimize the cumulative delay across all trains.

## Procedure and  Result
In our project, we used optimization techniques with the help of CPLEX Optimizer to create the best possible schedule for around 200 trains traveling through 17 railway zones in India. To simulate the train movements, we generated random data for their entry and exit times within each zone to  a .dat file. Our main goal was to minimize the total delay experienced by all trains. By applying these optimization methods, we aimed to find the most efficient schedule that reduced delays and improved the overall reliability of the railway system for the given data.




## Future Work

Real-world data and more data point  can be utilized to validate and enhance the project's  robustness,incorporating more accurate representations of train operations.
